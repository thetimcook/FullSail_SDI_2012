<p>I go into Peachwave to get some frozen yogurt. When I go in I have a choice of getting a chocolaty or a fruity dessert, but I always go for chocolate, unless they don't have what I like. If they have Chocolate and Cupcake then Ill get that with reese's, oreo's and marshmallow cream on it. If they con't have cupcake then Ill just go for a fruity dessert. After I get my yogurt the way I like it I then have to pay for it. All I have is $5 so if it comes out to over $5 then I'm left with nothing. But if not I will get to enjoy my frozen treat. </p>
<p>Peachwave is a self serve frozen yogurt shop that has a slew of flavors with a ton of toppings to put on top. The flavors change regularly so the outcome of this script with often vary. I also have the price as a variable because price in dependent upon how much yogurt I get. Every trip is could leave me with a different treat each time.  </p>
